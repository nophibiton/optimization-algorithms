# optimization-algorithms

This repository provides Matlab codes for different algorithms used in Engineering Design Optimization by Martins and Ning. The book is freely available online and can be downloaded here [https://mdobook.github.io/](https://mdobook.github.io/).

The follwing matlab codes are arrange based on book chapters/sections. The following includes:
1) [Newton Methods](https://github.com/nophibiton/optimization-algorithms/tree/main/3-8%20Newton%20Based%20Solvers)
2) [Line Search Algorithms](https://github.com/nophibiton/optimization-algorithms/tree/main/4-3%20Line%20search)
   - Backtracking (Armijo rule)
   - Strong wolfe conditions
3) [Search direction](https://github.com/nophibiton/optimization-algorithms/tree/main/4-4%20Search%20direction)
   - [steepest descent](https://github.com/nophibiton/optimization-algorithms/tree/main/4-4%20Search%20direction/1%20Steepest%20Descent)
   - [BFGS](https://github.com/nophibiton/optimization-algorithms/tree/main/4-4%20Search%20direction/2%20BFGS)
   - [LBFGS](https://github.com/nophibiton/optimization-algorithms/tree/main/4-4%20Search%20direction/3%20LBFGS)
4) [Particle swarm optimization](https://github.com/nophibiton/optimization-algorithms/tree/main/7-7%20Particle%20swarm%20optimization)
