# optimization-algorithms

This repository provides Matlab codes for different algorithms used in Engineering Design Optimization by Martins and Ning. The book is freely available online and can be downloaded here [https://mdobook.github.io/](https://mdobook.github.io/).

The follwing matlab codes are arrange based on book chapters/sections. The following includes:
1) Newton Methods
2) Line Search Algorithms
   - Backtracking (Armijo rule)
   - Strong wolfe conditions
3) Search direction
   - steepest descent
   - BFGS
   - LBFGS
